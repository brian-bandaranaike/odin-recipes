  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic butter that makes it
    taste like a <em>steakhouse quality</em> meal. You'll be impressed
    at how <em>easy</em> it is to make the <strong>perfect</strong> steak
    that's seared on the outside, and <strong>perfectly tender</strong> inside.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 lbs New York Strip Steaks, or Ribeye or Top Sirloin Steaks</li>
    <li>1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered</li>
    <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels.
      Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt
      and 1 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over
      medium-high heat, swirling to coat. Once the oil is very hot,
      add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side
      for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and
      cook another 3-4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak on its 
      sides to render the white fat and sear the edges
      (1-minute per edge).</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter,
      quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan. Spoon the
      butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter
      on your spoon. Continue spooning the sauce over the steak
      for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from
      your desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise
      another 5-10 degrees while steaks rest).</li>
    <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest
      10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve. Spoon
      extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</li>
  </ol>
